## 🎯 Deployment Strategy

### Recommended: Fresh Deployment
**Best for your 1-week Railway deployment**

**Why?**
- ✅ Clean database, no conflicts
- ✅ Fastest path to production (15 min)
- ✅ All migrations tested and ready
- ✅ Railway handles everything automatically

**What about my local data?**
- Your local development database stays intact
- Railway creates a fresh production database
- You can manually recreate test data after deployment

**Steps:**
1. Don't run migrations locally
2. Deploy to Railway (fresh MySQL database)
3. Railway runs all migrations automatically
4. Seed initial data
5. Create admin accounts

See `MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md` for details.
