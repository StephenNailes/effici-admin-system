## üîç Variable Explanations

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `APP_KEY` | base64:... | Encryption key (MUST be unique!) |
| `APP_URL` | https://... | Your Railway app URL |
| `DB_*` | ${{...}} | Railway template variables (auto-filled) |
| `MAIL_MAILER` | log | Emails written to logs (testing) |

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

After setting variables, check deployment logs:

```powershell
railway logs
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ "Configuration cached successfully"
- ‚úÖ "Routes cached successfully"
- ‚úÖ "Migration table created successfully"
- ‚úÖ No APP_KEY errors

## üîÑ Alternative Mail Providers

### Option 1: Resend (Free: 100 emails/day)
```env
MAIL_MAILER=resend
RESEND_API_KEY=<<< YOUR RESEND API KEY >>>
```

### Option 2: Keep log (Testing only)
```env
MAIL_MAILER=log
```
Emails appear in Railway logs (`railway logs`)

## üÜò Common Issues

### "APP_KEY not set" error
‚û°Ô∏è Ensure APP_KEY starts with `base64:`
‚û°Ô∏è No spaces or quotes around the value

### "Database connection failed"
‚û°Ô∏è Ensure MySQL plugin is added to project
‚û°Ô∏è Database variables use `${{...}}` syntax (Railway templates)

### "SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002]"
‚û°Ô∏è Wait 30 seconds for MySQL to initialize
‚û°Ô∏è Check MySQL service is "Active" in Railway

### Changes not applying
‚û°Ô∏è Click "Deploy" button after changing variables
‚û°Ô∏è Wait for new deployment to complete

## üìù Notes

- **Never commit .env to Git** (already in .gitignore)
- **APP_KEY must be unique** per environment (dev, production)
- **Database variables** are auto-managed by Railway
- **HTTPS** is automatic on Railway (no config needed)
