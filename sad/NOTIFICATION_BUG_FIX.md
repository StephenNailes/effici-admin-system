# Notification System Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Request on Panel Open
**Problem**: When opening the notification panel, two requests were being made:
- One from the sidebar's `onOpen` callback calling `fetchNotifications()`
- One from the visibility change handler or component mount

**Solution**: Removed the redundant `fetchNotifications()` call from sidebar's `onOpen` and `onClose` handlers. The shared context automatically handles fetching, so manual calls are unnecessary.

**Files Changed**:
- `resources/js/components/sidebar.tsx`

### 2. Mark as Read Not Working
**Problem**: The `is_read` flag was inverted in the backend response. When a notification was marked as read (`read_at` is set), the API was returning `is_read: false` instead of `is_read: true`.

**Root Cause**: In `NotificationService.php`, line 316 had:
```php
'is_read' => is_null($notification->read_at), // WRONG - inverted logic
```

This meant:
- `read_at = NULL` → `is_read = true` (unread shown as read)
- `read_at = timestamp` → `is_read = false` (read shown as unread)

**Solution**: Fixed the logic to:
```php
'is_read' => !is_null($notification->read_at), // CORRECT
```

Now:
- `read_at = NULL` → `is_read = false` (unread)
- `read_at = timestamp` → `is_read = true` (read)

**Files Changed**:
- `app/Services/NotificationService.php`

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added helpful emoji-based logging to track notification operations:
- 📡 Fetching notifications
- ⏸️ Skipped due to debounce
- ✅ Success
- ❌ Error
- 📖 Marking as read

This makes debugging much easier in the browser console.

**Files Changed**:
- `resources/js/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Open notification panel - should only see ONE request in terminal
- [x] Mark notification as read - should work and update UI
- [x] Check browser console - should show helpful log messages
- [x] Verify debouncing - rapid opens should skip fetches
- [x] Test unread badge - should decrease when marking as read

## Expected Behavior Now

### Opening Notification Panel
- **Before**: 2 requests (one ~500ms, one ~0.1ms)
- **After**: 0 requests (uses cached data from context)
- If cache is stale (>3 seconds), then 1 request only

### Marking as Read
- **Before**: Not working (inverted logic)
- **After**: Works correctly, updates UI immediately

### Browser Console
```
📡 Fetching notifications...
✅ Notifications fetched successfully
📖 Marking notification 123 as read...
✅ Notification 123 marked as read
⏸️ Skipping notification fetch - too soon since last fetch
```

## Performance Impact
- **Reduced API calls**: Panel open no longer triggers fetch
- **Better UX**: Mark as read now works instantly
- **Easier debugging**: Clear console logs with emojis
